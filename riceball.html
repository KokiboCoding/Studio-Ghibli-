  <h3 class="direction">Directions</h3>
  <p class="rice-ball-direction">
    <ol>- Place the rice in rice pot - wash the rice until the water becomes no longer murky and clear. 
      When measuring the water. *Tip* have your fingertip touch the rice and the water should reach the first
      line on your finger.
    </ol>
    <ol>- Put the bowl in the rice cooker and have it do it's magic!</ol>
    <ol>- After the rice is cooked, let it cool it a bit as it would be too hot to the touch. </ol>
    <ol>- Place salt in a bowl of warm water and mix it. </ol>
    <ol>-  Once the rice is cool, wet hands with the salt water and make a triangle or circular shape</ol>
  </p>
  <p> Then BAM! You got your onigiri! (PS: you can add Japanese seasoning or seaweed) </p>
